WORDS FROM PROMOTERS-
We are very glad to combine the soulful southern Asian countries in our friendly cricket match. We have started it with a very smaller version of league match.
And we are hoping with every ones respect, love and support we can move this league with all the southern Asian countries participating in our GCCL league and make it a vast success not only in USA but all over the world.
